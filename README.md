# XIMI monorepo

This repository is a turbo monorepo containing:

1. XIMI frontend clients

   1. Control
   2. Performer
   3. Scout
   4. Output

2. XIMI server

Refactor will allow monorepo to all run with `pnpm` instead of npm, and upgrade all dependency packages as well as the node version to v18.x.
